CAPSTONE PROJECT
- Create a full-stack web application using MongoDB, Express React, and Node (MERN)

APHASIA GETS BETTER

- Aphasia is a communication disorder that is most commonly caused by stroke.
- Between 1 and 2 million people live with Aphasia in the United States.
- For people with moderate to severe aphasia, traditional speech therapy presents diminishing returns after the second year.

- While my hope is for this website to become a suite of useful applications, the core concept is this: an impacted brain needs a lot of repetition to make progress, but most speech interventions provide speech prompts which aren't meaningful to the patient. One of the main functions of the website is to create social conversation speech prompts which use personal data to make the exercises more meaningful. 

- In simpler terms: It makes sense to practice speech that you'll actually use in your daily life.

MY 4 PAGES
- My Profile: the first page is the registration page which creates a new user or else utilizes a default user profile. There are update and delete options that aren't yet fully functional.

- Daily Schedule: this page will hopefully be a useful organizational tool for the user, which is both a good cognitive exercise and a way of keeping them engaged with the website

- Speech Practice: this page cycles through social sentence prompts and uses user data to fill the sentences with personally meaningful information, like a siblings name or the city where they live.

- Stroke Centers: this page utilizes a mongoDB collection that I made myself help users identify certified stroke centers in any state. 
    - The greatest fear, and an all-to-common reality for stroke survivors living with aphasia, is having another stroke. Not everyone is aware that different hospitals have different capabilities when it comes to stroke treatment. In fact, only approximately 5.5% of medical centers are considered a "Comprehensive Stroke Center" and fewer than half of U.S. states have a law that mandates receiving treated at a certified stroke center when stroke is expected.

FRUSTRATIONS AND FUTURE PLANS
- I've been working on this project for 2 months, which in some ways has been great. I've developed several more pages beyond what is shown here, including a Mirror Activity that turns on the user's camera and allows the user to observe themselves sounding out vowels, words, and so forth. I'm thoroughly excited about this project and plan to launch it sometime in the coming year.

- However! Building the plane while I was still learning how to build a plane has created a lot of challenges with this Capstone project. I spent a lot of time and energy trying to modify my preexisting ideas and code to fit the requirements of the Capstone project.

OTHER NOTES
- While still a work in progress, I've been thinking about accessibility the whole way through: high contrast color scheme, large print, extra line spacing and so on, for readability. As I continue to develop on-screen content, I will bear in mind the impaired visual attention of many people living with aphasia.

- The user profiles have full CRUD routes built. My aim is to make it so that the user can edit their own profile information on the frontend: add friends, change cities, delete siblings (just kidding), for the benfit of the dynamic speech therapy prompts.
